                    I recently moved to the U.S. for my studies and have been enjoying learning new things outside of tech, like cooking! I've gotten into meal prepping every three days and have become much more mindful about nutrition and maintaining a balanced diet. It's been a fun way to bring structure, creativity, and a bit of experimentation into my daily routine.
